### This section is often overlooked, but it is a great way to show appreciation for the people and other projects that have helped you along the way.  It is also a great way to show potential contributors that you are a grateful person and that you are willing to give credit where credit is due.

# About

### The Open Source Software (OSS) community underpins countless businesses worldwide, with over 50% of Fortune 500 companies relying on it for their workflowsâ€”a number poised to grow as more projects gain traction. However, this growth hinges on consistent feature development, which is challenging without more developers. Research by Ravi Sen, Siddhartha S. Singh, and Sharad Borle found that adding 10 developers to a project increases average subscribers by 5.65%, demonstrating a clear link between developer engagement and user adoption.
Given this, OSS projects must prioritize lowering barriers to entry and welcoming community contributionsâ€”the very ethos of OSS. Unfortunately, this is far from the norm. A 2014 study revealed that only 5.4% of 2,000 projects included architectural documentation, a crucial tool for scaling and collaboration. While many OSS projects have achieved remarkable growth, more widespread emphasis on software architecture documentation could drive success for countless lesser-known initiatives.
Effective documentation should guide users and developers through a projectâ€™s purpose, workflow, and future direction. A basic overview and installation guide are insufficient; developers need clear navigation of the source code and actionable tasks, while users benefit from insight into future plans and transparent communication channels.
This README aims to set a standard for OSS documentation, improving project accessibility and fostering contributions from both the community and aspiring developers.


## Built With

#### Listing the major tools and languages used in the project helps it appear in filtered search results for any included library.  Additionally, it allows developers to quickly identify whether a library they are proficient in is part of the project.  Refer to the "Markdown Links and Images" section of the HTML version of this file to learn how these logo URLs are created.

# Developers

## Contributing

#### Contributions are, in my opinion, the greatest part of OSS and are what will be the key to continuing the growth of the community. One of the main goals of this README is to facilitate contributions of potential developers. In this section, developers must be sure to lay out any coding styling choices that they may have so that the source code can remain as uniform as possible. One such project that has an impressive contributions page is *htop* by [htop-dev](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop) who point all potential incoming contributors to their [style guide](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/blob/main/docs/styleguide.md)
1. [Fork the Project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) 2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`) 3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`) 4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`) 5. [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

# Installation

## Prerequisites

#### Ensure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/), [python][pythonLogo-url] (and presumably pip too). Best bet, download the official release for your platform (Operating System) from the provided homepages and their download section. On Windows, your best bet is to use the resulting Git Bash application that will become available after installing git.
Comfirm prerequisites by running the following command: ```bash git --version && python --version && pip --version ```
Download and navigate into the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/montymi/ClearDocs/ && cd ClearDocs ```
There are currently no additional prerequisites for this project.


## Setup

#### Convert contents of README.md to the raw form, copy file and paste into your project. (Boring ik, that is a WIP for after the holidays ðŸ˜Š.)


### This section should walk through installation on various operating systems as well as any installation options.  The readability of this section will make or break whether someone will use the project, since this section is often the most looked at section.


# License

### *Documentation must include a license section in which the type of license and a link or reference to the full license in the repository is given.*
Distributed under the GPL-3.0 License. See `LICENSE.txt` for more information.


# Structure

### Less than 6% of GitHub projects include documentation or diagrams about the software's architecture. Since larger projects can often have a very convoluted source code structure, diagrams are the ideal method of displaying the flow of the project.

Advanced usage instructions should be placed here. These can include multiple lines of detailed explanation.


## Getting Started

Manually convert the section information to fit project, including the URLs for tools, tests, and contact cards which need to be found, added, and called. 


### Users are much more likely to use and test a project if they can quickly determine how best to use the software and whether or not it really is what they are looking for. Clear usage examples also give incoming developers a chance to better understand the code and its intended use.
*Here is an example from this project that hopefully won't stand for very long:*
